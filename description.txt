1.	We have up to the fourth part of the assignment done
2.	Our array is of size ten and holds segements of one second long.
3.	Run the programme through the command prompt.
4.	We have two threads, a consumer thread and a producer thread.
5.	Our code runs through the problem as such, the producer thread (when the critical memory space is available ie the array),
	reads one second segements and adds them to the buffer up to ten seconds where the consumer thread kicks in and itterates  
	through the array and outputs the audio, emptying the array as it does so.
